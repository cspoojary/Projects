## 📌 Project Overview
- This project demonstrates the complete Machine Learning workflow
for predicting house prices using the Linear Regression algorithm.
The focus is on understanding data preprocessing, model training,
evaluation, and visualization.
---

## 🎯 Objective
To build and evaluate a regression model that predicts house prices
based on available features.

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## 📊 Dataset
- <a href = "https://github.com/cspoojary/Projects/blob/main/House_Price_prediction/house_rent.xls">Dataset</a>
- The dataset contains features related to house properties and a
target variable representing house prices.

---

## 🔍 Methodology
1. Loaded and explored the dataset
2. Performed basic data preprocessing
3. Selected features and target variable
4. Split data into training and testing sets
5. Trained a Linear Regression model
6. Evaluated the model using R² Score and Mean Squared Error
7. Visualized Actual vs Predicted prices

---

## 📈 Results
- R² Score: **-0.0067**
- The negative R² score indicates weak linear relationships
  between features and the target variable.
- This project emphasizes understanding the end-to-end
  Machine Learning pipeline rather than achieving high accuracy.

---
## 📊 Model Evaluation Visualizations

- Actual vs Predicted plot shows prediction accuracy.
- Regression line explains the relationship between area and price.
- Residual plot highlights prediction errors and model limitations.


---

## 📌 Conclusion
The Linear Regression model was successfully implemented and evaluated.
Although the model performance is limited due to dataset characteristics,
this project provides hands-on experience with regression modeling,
evaluation metrics, and result interpretation.
