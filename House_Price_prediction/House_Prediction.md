# House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates the complete Machine Learning workflow
for predicting house prices using the Linear Regression algorithm.
The focus is on understanding data preprocessing, model training,
evaluation, and visualization.

---

## 🎯 Objective
To build and evaluate a regression model that predicts house prices
based on available features.

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset contains features related to house properties and a
target variable representing house prices.

---

## 🔍 Methodology
1. Loaded and explored the dataset
2. Performed basic data preprocessing
3. Selected features and target variable
4. Split data into training and testing sets
5. Trained a Linear Regression model
6. Evaluated the model using R² Score and Mean Squared Error
7. Visualized Actual vs Predicted prices

---

## 📈 Results
- R² Score: **-0.0067**
- The negative R² score indicates weak linear relationships
  between features and the target variable.
- This project emphasizes understanding the end-to-end
  Machine Learning pipeline rather than achieving high accuracy.

---

## 📊 Visualization
An Actual vs Predicted price scatter plot is included to visually
evaluate model performance.

---

## 📌 Conclusion
The Linear Regression model was successfully implemented and evaluated.
Although the model performance is limited due to dataset characteristics,
this project provides hands-on experience with regression modeling,
evaluation metrics, and result interpretation.
